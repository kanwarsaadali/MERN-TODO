npm i changes start script
install mongo,express,cors,doteenv
add server.js file connect app to port and listen it console run cmd with npm start
database acces : add user on mongodb kanwar-sikandar-ali-todo mukarram1361 give Built-in Role as admin
network access : allow access from any where
click database: connect , conect your application copy url and paste it on .env file and edit it
 

till here we succed to result 1 server running 2 mongodb conncetd || here i work mainly in server.js and .env file


Now we make routes in routes,js file and first test it, with on frontend
router.get("/",(req,res)=>{

    res.json({message:"Hi there ..."})

})

and use it with app.use on server.js 


install nodemon for not redreshing server every time


Now ,

create model = schema  = for mongodb = for structre of database
create controller = call model in controller
call controller in route


change route from => 

router.get("/",(req,res)=>{

    res.json({message:"Hi there ..."})

})

to =>
 router.get("/", getToDo);
router.post("/save", saveToDo);


add two things in server.js file :
app.use(express.json());
app.use(cors());

we arge getting an error text path not defined by putting this it has been solved

 useNewUrlParser: true,
 useUnifiedTopology: true


here we completed my backned side by model,controller,route   ..................................................
